The purpose of this GitHub repository is to store code demonstrating how to run geographically weighted regression models (hereafter, "GW models") of bird abundance within point count data. In contrast to other models where a single model coefficient is estimated for each variable and applied to all observations in the analyzed data-set, a GW model estimates a model coefficient for each variable at the location of each observation in the analyzed data-set. In other words, model coefficients vary in space.
